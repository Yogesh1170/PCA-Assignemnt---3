        "- **Direction Preservation:** An eigenvector represents a direction in the vector space that remains unchanged when a linear transformation is applied. In geometric terms, it is a vector that is not rotated or transformed in direction by the transformation. Instead, the transformation scales the eigenvector by a factor represented by the eigenvalue.\n",

The magnitude of the eigenvalue determines the degree of stretching or compression. If the eigenvalue is negative, it indicates stretching in the opposite direction, which is equivalent to a reflection.\n",

The eigenvalue indicates how much the eigenvector's magnitude changes after the transformation. If the eigenvalue is 1, it means no scaling occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Significance of Magnitude:** The magnitude of an eigenvalue is crucial. If it's greater than 1, it signifies stretching, while if it's between 0 and 1, it implies compression. If the magnitude is 1, there is no scaling, and if it's negative, there is reflection.\n",
